<div class="textblock"><p class="">Everybody loves playing Bomberman. Good news. The goal of this project is to create a full implementation of a 3D Bomberman video game.</p>
<p class=""><b>Objectives</b></p>
<p class="">There are several distinct objectives in this project.</p>
<p class="">• Beeing able to produce a full video game, not just a pedagogical projet. This means, that the final produt should be usable by tiers, not just the students group who wrote it. One should not think "this is some early access crap" when playing your game.</p>
<p class="">• Learning the low level use of OpenGL without the help of modern game engines, and why not start your own (tiny) little one ?</p>
<p class="">• Learning team work on a full scale project. Everybody can’t work on everything, so it’s an excellent opportunity to discover that communication, management and documentation are keys to success.</p>
<h2>Generic instructions</h2>
<p class="">• This project must be in C++.</p>
<p class="">• You are free to use any compiler you like.</p>
<p class="">• Your code must compile with: -<a class="el" href="class_wall.html" title="wall GameObject">Wall</a> -Wextra -Werror.</p>
<p class="">• You are free to use any C++ version you like.</p>
<p class="">• You must use the last available version of OpenGL for anything related to graphics.</p>
<p class="">• You are free to use any additionnal library you like, but NOT full game engines like Ogre for instance.</p>
<p class="">• You must provide a Makefile with the usual rules.</p>
<p class="">• Any class that declares at least one attribute must be written in canonical form. Inheriting from a class that declares attributes does not count as declaring attributes. Exceptions don’t have to be canonical.</p>
<p class="">• It’s forbidden to implement any function in a header file, except for templates and the virtual destructor of a base class.</p>
<p class="">• The “keyword” "using namespace" is forbidden.</p>
<h2>Generalities</h2>
<p class="">So, here we are. You must code a 3D version of Bomberman, functional, and complete with graphics, animations and levels. Your version being a solo game, we expect at least:</p>
<p class="">• The player can acces a main menu allowing him to start a new game, load a save, adjust game settings and exit the game.</p>
<p class="">• In game, the feeling, pace and difficulty must be as close as possible from the original game.</p>
<p class="">• To beat the game, the player must win at least 3 different levels. It’s up to you to code a longer game, but 3 levels is the minimum acceptable.</p>
<p class="">• If the player looses, the game must state it clearly and behave like a game should, like restarting the current level, or issuing a game over for instance. Likewise, if the player beats the game, it must also be stated clearly and offer a reasonable behaviour like displaying credits and getting back to the main menu.</p>
<p class="">• Sounds ! Musics ! A silent video game is a crappy one ! The main menu and the 3 levels must have their own music. Also, every relevant events must trigger a sound, like a bomb exploding, picking up a power up, killing an ennemi, dying, etc.</p>
<h2>Technical aspects</h2>
<p class="">• Your game MUST use the last version of OpenGL for anything related to graphics.</p>
<p class="">• The visual assets must be 3D, but the gameplay must stay 2D like the original game. For instance, if the player dies, the camera may shift its angle and spin around him while the death animation plays, or at the beginning of a level, the camera may fly around the level before focusing above the player. A good exemple of a 3D game with a 2D gameplay might be Mario Wii.</p>
<p class="">• Free animated 3D models of a bomberman and its ennemies might be hard to find online. As a consequence, you can skin your game as you wish and use any animated 3D model you like. The gameplay and visual feeling must be a Bomberman at first sight, but the actual models and textures can be anything.</p>
<p class="">• As stated in the previous section, your main menu must allow to customize the game settings. It must be possible to customize at least:</p>
<p class="">◦ The screen resolution</p>
<p class=""><br />
 ◦ Windowed or full screen mode</p>
<p class=""><br />
 ◦ Key bindings</p>
<p class=""><br />
 ◦ Music and sounds volumes</p>
<p class=""><br />
• The game must offer a way to save the player’s progression and restore it on demand. It could be a regular save system or a campain mecanic. As long as the feature is present, it’s up to you to integrate it in your game. Anyway, This persitance MUST remain even if the game is exited completly and executed again.</p>
<h2>To run and install on WeThinkCode_ Mac OS.</h2>
<p class="">• Have Xquartz installed through Managment Software Center</p>
<p class="">• Have brew installed ( sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tolsadus/42homebrewfix/master/install.sh)" )</p>
<p class="">• Have cmake installed ( brew install cmake )</p>
<p class="">• generate the Makefile with "cmake -B./tmp -H."</p>
<p class="">• compile with "make -C tmp"</p>
<p class="">• run witn "./BomberMan"</p>
